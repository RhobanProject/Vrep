<h1>Object common properties dialog</h1>

<p>The object common properties dialog is part of the <a href="sceneObjectPropertiesDialog.htm">scene object properties dialog</a>, which is located at [Menu bar --&gt; Tools --&gt; Scene object properties]. You can also open the dialog with a double-click on an object icon in the <a href="userInterface.htm#SceneHierarchy">scene hierarchy</a>, or with a click on its <a href="userInterface.htm#toolbars">toolbar</a> button:<br>
</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Scene object properties toolbar button]</p>
<br>

<p>In the scene object properties dialog, click  the <strong>Common</strong> button to display the object common properties dialog. The dialog displays the settings and parameters of the last selected <a href="objects.htm">object</a>. If no object is selected, the dialog is inactive. If more than one object is selected, then some parameters can be copied from the last selected object to the other selected objects (<strong>Apply to selection</strong>-buttons):<br>

<br>


<li><strong>Selectable</strong>: indicates whether the object can be selected in the scene. Objects can always be selected in the <a href="userInterface.htm#SceneHierarchy">scene hierarchy</a>. Refer also to the <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simSetObjectProperty">simSetObjectProperty</a> function.
</li>
<li><strong>Select base of model instead</strong>: if enabled, then selecting the object in the scene will select its first parented object marked as <strong>object is model base</strong> instead (see further down). This property is convenient when protecting a model from faulty manipulations, allowing it to be manipulated as a single entity together with other objects. Refer to the <a href="models.htm">section on models</a> and also to the <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simSetObjectProperty">simSetObjectProperty</a> function. <br>
</li>
<li><strong>Don't show as inside model selection</strong>: when selected, and the object is part of a <a href="models.htm">model</a>, then the model bounding box (i.e. model selection bounding box) will not encompass that object. This is useful for invisible objects that might make the model bounding box appear too big. This property has no functional effect. Refer also to the <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simSetObjectProperty">simSetObjectProperty</a> function.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Size factor</strong>: every object can be scaled (resized) at any time, also during simulation. The size factor will be scaled in a similar way and can be accessed programmatically in order to adjust a code's behavior (e.g.<a href="childScripts.htm"> child script</a>). Imagine a 2-wheeled kinematic robot whose movement is controlled in a simple way through a child script: the child script will calculate the new position of the robot according to several parameters (wheel rotation velocity, wheel diameter and distance between the two wheels). If the user scales the robot, the child script should adjust its calculation according to the new size parameters (wheel diameter and distance between the two wheels). It can do that by using the <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simGetObjectSizeFactor">simGetObjectSizeFactor</a> <a href="apiOverview.htm">API</a> function.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Ignored for view-fitting</strong>: objects with this item selected will not be taken into account when fitting a scene to a view while no object is selected. Usually floors and similar will be tagged as such. Refer also to the <a href="userInterface.htm">view fitting toolbar button</a> and to the <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simCameraFitToView">simCameraFitToView api function</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility layers</strong>: each object in V-REP can be assigned to one or several visibility layers. If there is at least one visibility layer that matches the <a href="layerSelectionDialog.htm">layer selection dialog</a> layers, then the object will be visible (given that its visibility property is enabled). By default, a <a href="shapes.htm">shape</a> is assigned to the first layer, a <a href="joints.htm">joint</a> to the second layer, a <a href="dummies.htm">dummy</a> to the third layer, etc.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Collidable</strong>: allows enabling or disabling <a href="collisionDetection.htm">collision detection</a> capability for the selected<a href="collidableObjects.htm"> collidable object</a>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Measurable</strong>: allows enabling or disabling <a href="distanceCalculation.htm">minimum distance calculation</a> capability for the selected <a href="measurableObjects.htm">measurable object</a>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Ignored during path planning</strong>: allows enabling or disabling<a href="collisionDetection.htm">collision detection</a> capability and <a href="distanceCalculation.htm">minimum distance calculation</a> capability specifically for <a href="pathPlanningModule.htm">path planning tasks</a>. If for instance, a scene contains an automatic door, the door can be flagged as <strong>Ignored during path planning</strong>, which will allow a path planning task to find a path through the door while still being able to register collisions between the door and other objects.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Renderable</strong>: allows enabling or disabling the <a href="visionSensors.htm">vision sensor</a> detection capability for the selected <a href="renderableObjects.htm">renderable object</a>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Cuttable</strong>: allows enabling or disabling the <a href="mills.htm">mill cutting</a> capability for the selected <a href="cuttableObjects.htm">cuttable object</a>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Detectable</strong>: allows enabling or disabling <a href="proximitySensors.htm">proximity sensor</a> detection capability for the selected <a href="detectableObjects.htm">detectable object</a>. Clicking <strong>Edit detectable details</strong> allows you to edit the detectable details.<br>
</li>



<li><strong>Object is model base</strong>: indicates whether the object should act as the base of a <a href="models.htm">model</a>. An object flagged as <em>base of model</em> has special properties (e.g. saving or copying the object will also automatically save/copy all its children and children's children, etc.). Additionally, when such an object is selected, the selection bounding box is displayed as thick stippled lines, encompassing the whole model. Refer to <a href="models.htm">models</a>, and to the <strong>select base of model instead</strong> item above.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Edit model properties</strong>: allows opening the <a href="modelDialog.htm">model dialog</a>. </li>

<li><strong>Scaling</strong>: objects or models can be scaled in a flexible way in V-REP. The size of an object or model, and all related properties are scaled appropriately (e.g. joint ranges, velocity settings, masses, etc.) so that the scaled object or model can normally continue to operate (but at a different scale). <br>
</li>

<li><strong>View / edit custom data</strong>: opens a dialog that allows to visualize and edit custom data attached to the object:</li>

<p align=center><img src="images/objectCustomData1.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Object custom data dialog]</p>
<br>







<li class=tabTab><strong>Attached custom data</strong>: displays a summary of the custom data that is attached to this object, in the format: header number [data size], header number [data size], etc. That data can be read and written through API calls (<a href="apiFunctions.htm#simAddObjectCustomData">simAddObjectCustomData</a> and <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simGetObjectCustomData">simGetObjectCustomData</a>). The header number is the identifier for the custom data and/or developer who added it. If you plan to add custom data (as a company or individual), always use the same header (because only you will know what data type is stored under that header) and stick to it. The best is to use the serial number of your V-REP copy. Otherwise, you risk collision with other developer's custom data which might use the same header as yours. Additionally, if you have various type of custom data to add, it is your responsibility to pack/code the data under a same header (e.g. you could use: header number, data1ID, data1Length, data1, data2ID, data2Length, data2, etc.)<br>
</li>
<li class=tabTab><strong>Add</strong>: allows adding simple custom data to an object. The data to be added should be written in the <strong>command line</strong> in following format: header number, number1, number2, number3, etc. Number written without '.' are assumed to be integers, otherwise they are assumed to be floating-point numbers. Numbers are added to the custom data buffer for the given header number in a little-endian fashion. If complex data has to be added/extracted, use the API calls (<a href="apiFunctions.htm#simAddObjectCustomData">simAddObjectCustomData</a> and <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simGetObjectCustomData">simGetObjectCustomData</a>).<br>
</li>
<li class=tabTab><strong>Clear</strong>: allows removing custom data from an object. The header number of the data to be removed should be written in the empty box to its right. If complex data has to be added/extracted, use the API calls (<a href="apiFunctions.htm#simAddObjectCustomData">simAddObjectCustomData</a> and <a href="apiFunctions.htm#simGetObjectCustomData">simGetObjectCustomData</a>).
</li>


<br>
<br>







<li><strong>Assembling</strong>: opens a dialog that allows to specify how the <a href="userInterface.htm#toolbars">assembling toolbar button</a> will handle the object during assembly (if objects are assembled in a different way than via the assembling toolbar button, then following settings will have no influence):</li>

<p align=center><img src="images/assembling.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Assembling behaviour dialog]</p>
<br>







<li class=tabTab><strong>Object can have the 'child' role</strong>: if checked, then the object can be attached to another object (i.e. become another object's child), but only if the <strong>required match value</strong> matches the one of its parent object. This feature is useful in order to set a fixture compatibility criteria (e.g. gripper A can only be attached with a robot that has a tooltip of type A).</li>

<li class=tabTab><strong>Object can have the 'parent' role</strong>: if checked, then the object can have another obejct attached to itself  (i.e. become another object's parent), but only if the <strong>required match value</strong> matches the one of its child object. This feature is useful in order to set a fixture compatibility criteria (e.g. gripper A can only be attached with a robot that has a tooltip of type A).</li>

<li class=tabTab><strong>When assembling, apply a specific local transformation matrix</strong>: if checked, then when the object is assembled, a specific transformation matrix will be used as its new local transformation matrix. Click <strong>set matrix</strong> in order to select current local transformation matrix as the assembly matrix. This feature is useful in order to automatically position and orient an object correctly in relation to its new parent (e.g. in order to have a gripper automatically placed correctly at a robot's tooltip)</li>
