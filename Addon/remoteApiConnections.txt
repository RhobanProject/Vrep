// This file defines all the continuous remote API server services (started at remote API plugin initialization)
//
// Each remote API server service requires following 3 entries:
//
// portIndex@_port = xxxx 		// where xxxx is the desired port number (below 20000 are preferred for server services starting at V-REP start-up)
// portIndex@_debug = xxxx 		// where xxxx is true or false
// portIndex@_syncSimTrigger = xxxx 	// where xxxx is true or false. When true, then the service will be pre-enabled for synchronous operation. Only one service at a time can be pre-enabled for synchronous operation!
//
// In above strings, @ can be any number starting with 1. If more than one server service is required, then numbers need to be consecutive and starting with 1
