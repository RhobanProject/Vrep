<p>A joint is an <a href="objects.htm">object</a> that has at least one intrinsic Degree of Freedom (DoF). Joints are used to build mechanisms and to move objects as can be seen in following figures:

<p align=center><img src="images/joints2.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Robotic manipulator (left) and visible joints/motor (right)]</p>
<br>

<p>Joints are added to the <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a> with [menu bar --&gt; Add --&gt; Joint]. When positioning joints in the scene, use the <a href="coordinateDialog.htm">coordinate and transformation dialog</a> if you know the exact desired position and orientation. In other situations, when for instance you <a href="importExport.htm#Import">imported</a> meshes without knowing the exact position/orientation of associated joints, follow following steps:<br>
</p>

<li>Identify the <a href="shapes.htm">shape</a> that is directly linked to the joint. </li>

<li>Isolate the shape into a different scene (copy the shape from the current scene, create a new scene and paste the shape).<br>
</li>

<li>Enter the <a href="triangleEditMode.htm">triangle edit mode</a> or <a href="vertexEditMode.htm">vertex edit mode</a> and simplify the shape until you are left with a tube (or similar). Leave the edit mode.<br>
</li>

<li>Now the remaining of the original shape should have the same position and orientation as the joint you wish to add.<br>
</li>

<li>Add a joint.
</li>

<li>Select the joint then the shape, and in the coordinate and transformation dialog, click <strong>apply to selection</strong> for the orientation and position part of the <strong>coordinates</strong> section. The joint should now be correctly positioned.<br>
</li>

<li>The joint orientation might have to be adjusted by a 90 degrees rotation about its x or y-axis. This can be done in the <strong>transformations</strong> part of the same dialog (make sure <strong>own frame</strong> is selected).<br>
</li>

<li>The joint now has the correct position and orientation, and can be copied/pasted into the original scene.<br>
</li>


<p>
Following figures illustrate above procedure:

<p>Some joint data can be recorded by graph objects. Refer to <a href="graphs.htm">graphs</a> and <a href="dataStreamTypes.htm">graph data streams</a> for more information about how to record joint data.<br>
