<p>Graphs are <a href="objects.htm">objects</a> that can be used to record, visualize or export data from a <a href="simulation.htm">simulation</a>. They are very powerful and flexible. The user can select from a multitude of data types applied to specific objects to record. Data is recorded as a data stream (sequential list of data values) that can be visualized in three different ways:
</p>

<li><strong>Time graphs</strong>: a time graph of a single data stream (time vs data stream).
</li>

<li><strong>X/Y graphs</strong>: a graph that combines two data streams (data stream A vs data stream B).
</li>

<li><strong>3D curves</strong>: a 3D graph that combines three data streams in time (time vs (data stream A, data stream B, data stream C)).
</li>

<p>
Following figure illustrates the graph functionality:

<p>As are <a href="cameras.htm">cameras</a> and <a href="visionSensors.htm">vision sensors</a>, a graph is a <a href="viewableObjects.htm">viewable object</a>, which means that you can look at its image content which can be a time graph or an x/y graph (time graphs and x/y graphs are not directly visible in the scene; the graph first has to be associated with a view). See the <a href="pagesAndViews.htm">pages and views</a> section for more details on how to look at a graph. A graph is added to the scene with [Menu bar --&gt; Add --&gt; Graph]. What you see is the three dimensional representation of the graph. If a 3D curve was defined for that graph, that curve is directly visible as can be seen in following figure:<br>

<p>Data streams recorded by a graph can be exported to a *.csv file (Comma Separated Values) that can easily be imported by various applications (e.g. Excel). In the <a href="scenes.htm">scene</a>, select the graphs you want to export the data from, and select [Menu bar --&gt; File --&gt; Export selected graphs as CSV...]. The unit of exported data streams will be same as what is set in the <a href="settings.htm">user settings dialog</a>. Individual graph curves can also be copied to the clipboard for pasting into applications like Excel for instance: in a graph view (make sure the view is not a floating view, or double-click it to swap it with a <em>regular</em> view), hover over the curve you wish to copy until it gets highlighted, then select [Popup menu --&gt; Add --&gt; Curve to clipboard].<br>
</p>

<p>The graph functionality also allows to easily comparing curves from one simulation to another; to this end, curves can be duplicated to static curves: static curves are then displayed in stippled form in time graph views, x/y graph views or as 3D curves in the scene view, and won't be actualized or modified when another simulation is started. Hover over the curve you wish to duplicate as static curve until it gets highlighted (make sure the view is not a floating view, or double-click it to swap it with a <em>regular</em> view), then select [Popup menu --&gt; Add --&gt; Static duplicate of curve]. You can also duplicate curves to static curves in the <a href="graphPropertiesDialog.htm">graph dialog</a> (where static curves can also be removed). <br>
