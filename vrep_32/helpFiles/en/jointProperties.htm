<h1>Joint dialog</h1>

<p>The joint dialog is part of the <a href="sceneObjectPropertiesDialog.htm">scene object properties dialog</a>, which is located at [Menu bar --&gt; Tools --&gt; Scene object properties]. You can also open the dialog with a double-click on an object icon in the <a href="userInterface.htm#SceneHierarchy">scene hierarchy</a>, or with a click on its <a href="userInterface.htm#toolbars">toolbar</a> button:<br>
</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/objectPropertyToolbarButton.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Scene object properties toolbar button]</p>
<br>

<p>In the scene object properties dialog, click  the <strong>Joint</strong> button to display the joint dialog (the <strong>Joint</strong> button only appears if the last selection is a <a href="joints.htm">joint</a><a href="shapes.htm"></a><a href="lights.htm"></a><a href="cameras.htm"></a><a href="paths.htm"></a>). The dialog displays the settings and parameters of the last selected joint. If more than one joint is selected, then some parameters can be copied from the last selected joint to the other selected joints (<strong>Apply to selection</strong>-buttons. Be aware that this however only has an effect between joints of same type or mode):<br>

<br>


<li><strong>Motion handling of all joints enabled</strong>: allows enabling or disabling all joints in the scene that are in motion mode.<br>
</li>


<li><strong>Position is cyclic</strong>: indicates whether the joint position is cyclic (varies between -180 and +180 degrees without limitation). Only revolute joints can be cyclic.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Screw pitch</strong>: the pitch value of the joint. This property becomes available only with the Revolute/Screw-type of joint, when the <strong>Position is cyclic</strong>-checkbox is left unchecked. By default, the pitch is indicated in meters/degrees. User-interface units can be changed in the <a href="settings.htm">user settings dialog</a>.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Position minimum</strong>: the minimum allowed value of a non-cyclic revolute joint, a screw, or a prismatic joint.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Position range</strong>: the variation range of a non-cyclic revolute joint, a screw or a prismatic joint. A position of such a joint is limited between <strong>Position minimum</strong> and <strong>Position minimum</strong>+<strong>Position range</strong>. In the case of a spherical joint, <strong>Position range</strong> indicates the absolute value allowed for the <strong>Spherical alpha</strong> and <strong>Spherical beta</strong> values.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Position</strong>: intrinsic joint position of a revolute joint, a prismatic joint, or a screw.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Spherical alpha / beta / gamma</strong>: alpha- / beta- / gamma-angle of a spherical joint's Euler angles (alpha, beta, gamma). Internally, spherical joints don't use Euler angles and are not limited by Gimbal locks.
</li>

<li><strong>IK calculation weight</strong>: weight of the joint during <a href="inverseKinematicsModule.htm">inverse kinematics calculations</a>. In the case of a redundant manipulator for instance, this option enables you to favor certain joints over others during inverse kinematics resolution. A joint with a smaller weight will have a relatively smaller positional variation compared to other joints.<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Maximum step size</strong>: maximum positional variation permitted during one kinematic calculation pass or one <a href="pathPlanningModule.htm">path planning</a> calculation pass. A smaller step size usually results in longer calculations, but can be more stable. For <a href="inverseKinematicsModule.htm">inverse kinematics calculations</a>, this value can be overridden by the <strong>Ignore max. step sizes</strong> item in the <a href="ikDialog.htm">inverse kinematics dialog</a>.
</li>




<li><strong>Joint mode</strong>: the <a href="jointDescription.htm">control mode</a> of the joint. A joint can be in passive mode, in inverse kinematics mode, in dependent inverse kinematics mode, in dependent mode, in motion mode, or in torque/force mode. <br>
</li>

<li><strong>Hybrid operation</strong>: when the joint is in passive mode, inverse kinematics mode, dependent inverse kinematics mode, dependent mode or motion mode, it can optionally also be operated in a hybrid fashion: hybrid operation allows the joint to operate in a regular way, but additionally, just before <a href="dynamicsModule.htm">dynamics calculations</a>, the current joint position will be copied to the target joint position, and then, during dynamics calculations, the joint will be handled as a motor in position control (if and only if it is dynamically enabled). Refer to the <a href="jointDescription.htm">joint types and operation</a> section for details.<br>
</li>


<li><strong>Adjust dependency equation</strong>: if the joint is in dependent inverse kinematics mode or in dependent mode, then a linear equation can be specified that links the joint to another one. The values in this section of the dialog are all indicated in meters or radians independently from the unit selection in the user settings dialog to avoid confusion (this is an exception!).<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Adjust motion mode parameters</strong>: if the joint is in motion mode, clicking this button opens the joint motion mode dialog:</li>

<p align=center><img src="images/jointMotionModeDialog.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Joint motion mode dialog]</p>



<li class=tabTab><strong>Explicit handling</strong>: indicates whether the joint should be explicitly handled (in motion mode). If checked, the joint will not be handled when simHandleJoint(sim_handle_all_except_explicit) is called, but only if simHandleJoint(sim_handle_all) or simHandleJoint(jointHandle) is called. This is useful if the user wishes to handle the joint in a <a href="childScripts.htm">child script</a> rather than in the <a href="mainScript.htm">main script</a> (if not checked the joint will be handled twice, once when simHandleJoint(sim_handle_all_except_explicit) is called in the main script, and once when simHandleJoint(jointHandle) is called in the child script). Refer also to the section on <a href="explicitHandling.htm">explicit and non-explicit calls</a>.<br>
</li>

<li class=tabTab><strong>Infinite acceleration</strong>: ignores the <strong>Acceleration</strong> parameter and uses an infinite acceleration instead. Available only if the joint is in motion mode.<br>
</li>

<li class=tabTab><strong>Invert target velocity at limits</strong>: if enabled, the target velocity of a joint is automatically inverted when a limit is reached. This allows to easily implement back-and-forth motions. Has no effect if the joint is cyclic. Available only if the joint is in motion mode.<br>
</li>

<li class=tabTab><strong>Target velocity</strong>: desired joint velocity. Available only if the joint is in motion mode.<br>
</li>

<li class=tabTab><strong>Acceleration</strong>: this is the acceleration at which the joint velocity tries to follow the target joint velocity. Available only if the joint is in motion mode.
</li>
<br>



<li><strong>Show dynamic parameters</strong>: toggles the <a href="jointDynamicsProperties.htm">joint dynamics dialog</a>. The joint dynamics dialog allows to adjust a joint's dynamic properties.</li>









<li><strong>Joint length</strong>: length of the joint. Has no functional meaning.
</li>

<li><strong>Joint diameter</strong>: diameter of the joint. Has no functional meaning.
</li>

<li><strong>Adjust color A / B</strong>: color A is the color of the fixed part of the joint, color B is the color of the moving part of the joint.<br>
</li>
